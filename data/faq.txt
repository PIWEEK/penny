Who made Penpot and why?
Kaleidos Open Source created Penpot to provide a free, open-source UX/UI tool for cross-domain teams, bridging the gap between design and code, and making it accessible to everyone.
Why specifically Open Source?
Open source promotes a fairer society with more evenly distributed opportunities, fosters engaging communities, and allows for digital sovereignty; Penpot chose the Mozilla Public License 2.0 for consistent rules across web and native software.
Why is SVG its native format?
SVG is used as Penpot's native format because it enhances technology sovereignty, simplifies design-code cooperation, supports cross-domain team focus, and eliminates platform dependencies, promoting universal access.
How is Penpot different from proprietary products?
Penpot's distinct features include open source (offering technology sovereignty), SVG format (easier design-code cooperation), cross-domain team focus (embraced by both designers and developers), and no platform dependencies (browser-based, with a native app in development).
Why use Clojure and Clojurescript for Penpot?
Clojure and Clojurescript, as functional programming languages, excel at high-performance web tasks and manipulating mathematical objects, making them ideal for building a robust tool as Penpot in a short time.
What are the plans to charge for Penpot at some point?
Penpot plans to charge for enterprise features needed by medium to large organizations for legal or security compliance and senior management tools while keeping core features open source and free for power users.
Is there a Desktop app option for Penpot?
Yes, there is a community-contributed Penpot Desktop app by Korbs under active development, offering a desktop-like experience for individual use, but it is not officially supported yet.

How can I collaborate with others in Penpot?
Create a team, add projects, and invite members to work asynchronously or simultaneously; users can join multiple teams and access all available projects while still having private projects or drafts.
How can I share my designs with external stakeholders?

How can I learn how to use Penpot?
Right now, our suggested approach would be to take a look at our Youtube channel 5 and enjoy the quick tutorials on many aspects of Penpot.
How can I contribute to Penpot?
Contribute to Penpot in areas like code (report bugs, work on enhancements, or help with the exporter), UX/UI (create libraries, templates, or provide feedback), and languages (assist with translations by requesting access to Weblate). Reach out for guidance or information if needed.
Has Penpot kept a familiar pattern from reference tools despite potential improvements?
No, Penpot doesn't keep patterns just for familiarity. While familiar patterns are used to ease the learning curve, design decisions are also based on user testing, and improvements are made when a better solution is found, like with masks and toolbars.
